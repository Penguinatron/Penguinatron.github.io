<p style="text-align:center;">An EP of songs based on D&D campaigns I've played in with friends over the years</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">Written and recorded in the month of February, 2025. A nice break from the album I've been working on for quite some time now, it let me abandon the perfectionism one falls into when working towards something you really deeply want to work well, in favour of some nerdy, silly songs.</h4>

<p style="text-align:center;">This was worked on in-between practices, rehearsals and gigs for a bunch of different bands, making it the most musically busy period I've had in some time. Nevertheless, I think I've managed to keep on top of everything decently well, and I'm hoping to continue the momentum I've built up and get right back into the other projects on the slate.</h4>
