<h3>About:</h3>
<p>I started writing songs in earnest after a holiday in America in 2018. The many new sights, sounds and experiences gave me plenty of inspiration, and I basically treated the songs as a diary. The first song I wrote was <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjbmFINO7zU&list=PL776zvniD1Bhzm_s19u3-9EE4rhd7j2aM&index=2" target="_blank">Above The Clouds</a>, which I recorded on my Mum's iPad in the back of a car while driving along a road which was indeed above the clouds. I later finished the song on my iPhone after the drive. <br><br> A week later, I started the first song that would end up on the album, which was Stars (Oh Cosmos)- I then left it alone for two years, as I couldn't think of how to extend it (never delete old demos). While the songwriting pace slowed after the crazy blur of experiences that was the America holiday, I continued to write whenever an idea came to me. <br><br> I continued lyrically treating the songs like diary entries, and so when I came to record a bunch of the ones I had finished, I realised most of them shared a common theme- reluctantly growing up. That led to the title, which is a pun.

<h4>Recording:</h4>
<p>Several songs were recorded at my sixth form college, used in the composition module of my music performance BTEC. Finishing touches were added to these over lockdown, in between recording all of the other songs. I had about half of the album written pre-lockdown, and wrote the rest pretty much as I recorded the existing songs. It's quite a nice experience to have an idea, demo it, and then fully record it all in the same day. The result usually needs a lot of work once the fervour of creation has receded, but it's fun anyway.<br><br>I enlisted the help of several other musicians to record this album properly, namely <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/crojohnson/" target="_blank">/u/crojohnson</a>, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/cheemio/" target="_blank">Dustin Dicely</a>, Stanley Hagen, and Matthew Hilling. The mixing on Hello World was done mainly by Maisie Richards.</p>
