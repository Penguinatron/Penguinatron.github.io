<h3>About:</h3>
<h4>Writing:</h4>
<p>During the completely unexpected and mostly horrible year that was 2020, I tried to articulate my feelings via music many times, always with failure- mostly because of the lyrics, which always felt immature, pretentious, or melodramatic. My solution was to just give up on lyrics, and focus on doing an instrumental. As I wanted to include vocals as an instrument, I decided that I couldn't just have oohs and aahs, so I popped in a simple phrase which perfectly summed up how I felt about 2020: <br>'What a god-awful year'.</p>
<h4>Recording:</h4>
<p>This was quite a bit of fun to record. The song was created in chunks over a day or two, largely via vocal improvisations over equally quickly devised piano chords. Once I had a section fixed in my head, I recorded the ePiano, followed by the drums, then vocals, and then bass. Once I had the whole thing recorded, I found an amazing guitar player chilling in the other room, and asked him if he could try and play over what I had. With a little bit of direction from me for dynamics and intensity in various places, his guitar playing filled out the sound really well. Thanks Stan!</p>
<h4>Cover Art:</h4>
<p>As anyone who lived through it is no doubt aware, 2020 seemed just to be unlucky as a year. Being a nerd, I decided that the best way to represent this was via some terrible rolling using my D&D dice. The wooden background is my desk, and the coloured lighting comes from a bike light (red), an LED in an enclosure that's meant to attach to the index finger via an elastic band (blue), and a torch with paper in front of it for diffusion (white). Another torch was necessary to light the scene from above, as the writing was proving illedgible amongst all of the shadows the other lights were generating. </p>
<h4>Video:</h4>
<p>This was rushed, as videos aren't something I'm amazingly enthusiastic about, and consequently procrastinate on doing. Seeing as I have to do them, I try to make them at least somewhat interesting to look at. In this video, that was partially by luck; my initial plan was just to write somewhat amusing stuff on the whiteboard, and then throw the pens around to create an interesting slow motion effect. Something went wrong, however, while I was transferring the video from my phone to my computer, and I was landed with a glitched effect which I thought added to the visual nicely.</p>
<h4>In Retrospect:</h4>
<p>I'm still very happy with the harmonies and overall vocal performance on this song, particularly the transition into and use of mixed voice around the 1-minute mark. I've been working on improving my mixed voice for a while, so it was gratifying to have it sound nice here. The mixing, I feel, is also an improvement over my attempts at it on Morning Childhood. The vocals don't dominate over the instruments <i>quite</i> so much, and the low end sounds nice and full, at least to me. There are some slight timing issues here and there, and the ending isn't quite as good at the first part of the song, but I'm still pretty pleased with the final result.</p>
