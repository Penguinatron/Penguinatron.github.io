<h3>About:</h3>
<p>Song 5 of 12 in my lesser-known covers project.
<br><br>
I wanted to do something up-tempo and punchy after the relatively calm songs I covered in February, March and April, so I set about going through my iTunes library for inspiration. I found this song on a folk compilation album called Un-Herd Volume 79, which I'd got with a magazine a few years earlier. I was listening to a lot of Talking Heads at the time of recording this cover, and I wanted to try and capture their groove, down to the sparse and 'twitchy' sound which features in their earlier albums.</p>
<h4>Recording:</h4>
<p>This was quite a quick process. I'd just finished my first year at university, so I had a lot of time to work on this cover (note: I livestreamed the initial recording session, which can be seen <a href="https://youtu.be/0cnipjBVxdM" target="_blank">here</a>). I started by creating a drum sequence with a voice called 'Reel to reel', which set a nice retro vibe. I then added 'guitar' via distorted, double-tracked ukulele, which I hard-panned on either side. Bass was done via ePiano, which rounded out the sound nicely. Since I was having trouble getting MIDI working at the time, everything apart from the drums is recorded audio. My bad sense of rhythm worked against me again during the recording process, but I got there in the end.<br><br>I took cues from Talking Heads' 'Life During Wartime' for part of the baseline and the synth which comes in after the second chorus, and 'Cities' for the piano sound which starts at the second verse, as well as the sparseness of the song's first half.<br><br>The vocals needed some time to get right- not necessarily in tune or on the beat, but right for the tone of the song. I can be too much of a perfectionist with my vocals (even if the end result doesn't reflect that), so I tried to get them done quickly this time, with a focus on the feeling over the technique. I think it ended up sounding pretty good.</p>
<h4>Cover Art:</h4>
<p>Pretty lazy- it's just a still from the video, with some added text. I think it looks neat though.</p>
<h4>Video:</h4>
<p>The idea to use reflections came from the fact that I realised I could see minor imperfections on the inside of my lampshade by it's reflection on my laptop screen. I tested out writing on just tape, in order to avoid a visible writing surface, but the bulb whited-out the middle of the text, and the letters wobbled a bit; a post-it note was the best I could do. Positioning my webcam at the right angle put the reflection from my ceiling light just below the desk lamp's, and a bit of inspiration from Laurie Anderson told me what to do next.<br><br>As the video was still a little boring with just the Logic project scrolling and my silhouette singing, I added a gradual zoom-out throughout the video, and footage of various wars, in keeping with the song's lyrics. These range from World War 1 to the Israel/Palestine conflict of 2021, because humans always hate each other somewhere.</p>
<h4>In Retrospect:</h4>
<p>I'm quite happy with the groove that the song has- lots of what I record doesn't have the strongest or most dance-able beat in the world, so it was fun to give it a try, and I feel like it worked okay. I didn't quite manage to capture the weird, grating-but-good tone that the early Talking Heads albums have, but I think this cover was a good step in working out what that direction is.</p>
