<h3>About Me:</h3>
<p>I'm a 19-year-old musician studying Computer Science BSc (1st year) at the University of Birmingham.</p>
<p>I started learning music at about five years old, after watching Queen's performance at Live Aid. I took piano and singing lessons for many years, getting up to Grade 5 in singing and Grade 7 in Piano. Additionally, I've been teaching myself ukulele since the start of the first lockdown.</p>
<p>I'm currently working on a 'Lesser-Known Covers' project in which, in an attempt to keep musically active despite my university work, I'm doing a cover of a fairly unknown song for each month of 2021.</p>


<h4>At the moment:</h4>
<p> I'm coming up on the end of the first year of my CS course, which means end-term exams- lots of revision to do over the next week. Still working on my lesser-known covers project, but also getting some original stuff on the go again. I'm trying to put some more work into making this website look better too, although that's a gradual process.</p>

<p>This website is quite obviously under construction, and I'm using it as a way to learn HTML. It will probably look better soon.</p>
