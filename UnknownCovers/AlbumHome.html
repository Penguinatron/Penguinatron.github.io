<h3>About:</h3>
<p>In a bid to keep musically active through 2021 after university kept me from making much during late 2020, I decided to record a cover each month. An additional challenge I set myself was to try and cover lesser known songs, and in different styles to the originals. This worked well up until June, where trying to make stuff exhausted me to the extent that I called time on the project, and left it as a 5 song EP.<br><br>Despite the premature end of the endeavour, I'm quite proud of the sounds I managed to achieve, and I feel that I improved my mixing and ukulele skills. I tried out and practiced several techniques and styles which I think I can now use with some confidence in other projects.</p>
<h4>Recording:</h4>
<p>Each song was recorded over several days, with the arrangements either made up on the spot (about 60%), or pondered over for a few weeks (40%). The recording usually took place towards the end of the month, meaning that the videos were often rushed affairs. This can be wholly attributed to the fact that I greatly prefer making music over making videos. However, I think that apart from Joy Without Pleasure, the videos came out pretty well.<br><br>Several of the covers were recorded while I was at university, in student accomodation (my flatmates apparently found some of the isolated vocal parts quite amusing to listen to). The different environment changed the atmosphere of the music making process. I was separated from my normal music-making partners (my awesome brothers) and the room that I normally made my music in. Although I'm not particularly embarrassed when playing music in front of my brothers or parents, I felt that being out of their earshot made me less afraid to take some risks with the covers, leading to some pretty good moments.</p>
