<h4 style="text-align:center;">Introduction</h4>
<p style="text-align:center;">I recently (enough) <a href="../moop1/moop1.html">MIDI-fied a set of organ foot pedals for a friend in a prog band</a>, and in the interval between making the pedals and delivering them to him, I had a lot of fun using them myself, and decided to make myself a set. Unfortunately it turns out that organ foot pedals are quite expensive on their own- the only cheap way to get hold of a nice foot manual is to buy an entire electric home organ; they are sold for pennies by people who want them out of the house. Unfortunately I had nowhere to put one of these, and nothing to do with the rest of the organ once I'd taken out the foot pedals. I did however have a bag of staplers from my grandfather's workshop, which seem to work quite nicely as individual pedals in that they are well-built, rated for a good few cycles, and are of a decent size for foot operation. A somewhat silly idea then came to me.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">My staplers were gathered from a few different sources, the biggest being my grandfather's workshop. Following this, I found some more in second-hand shops, and a few other spots. After waiting patiently to find more, I ended up using some Christmas gift money to round out the number to 13, which is an octave plus one, and the same as MOOP1.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">Using my shoes, I worked out the spacing required for the staplers- roughly 45mm of clearance on either side is required to reduce the mistake frequency to an acceptable level. I used stacked <a href="https://bigpotato.co.uk/products/ok-play?srsltid=AfmBOorrZ8TmARP-p1KsknM6U-JNLaeJMQU-kBE0PV2PUxk4KLmdip7G">OK PLAY</a> tiles to elevate the accidental keys by about 30mm, and shunted them backwards relative to the natural keys by about 110mm, which gave good clearance and an easy-to-recognise keyboard layout. Due to their different heights and lengths, the finished layout looks a bit janky, but that's OK with me.</p>
