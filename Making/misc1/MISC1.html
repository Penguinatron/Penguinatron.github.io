<h4 style="text-align:center;">Introduction</h4>
<p style="text-align:center;">I recently (enough) <a href="../moop1/moop1.html">MIDI-fied a set of organ foot pedals for a friend in a prog band</a>, and in the interval between making the pedals and delivering them to him, I had a lot of fun using them myself, and decided to make myself a set. Unfortunately it turns out that organ foot pedals are quite expensive on their own- the only cheap way to get hold of a nice foot manual is to buy an entire electric home organ; they are sold for pennies by people who want them out of the house. Unfortunately I had nowhere to put one of these, and nothing to do with the rest of the organ once I'd taken out the foot pedals. I did however have a bag of staplers from my grandfather's workshop, which seem to work quite nicely as individual pedals in that they are well-built, rated for a good few cycles, and are of a decent size for foot operation. A somewhat silly idea then came to me.</p>
