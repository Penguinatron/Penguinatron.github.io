<p style="text-align:center;">A homemade MIDI controller allowing easy manipulation of my synth's many parameters, without a need for menu-diving.</p>

<h4 style="text-align:center;">Introduction</h4>

<p style="text-align:center;">I got a Roland JD-Xi for Christmas many years ago, and proceeded to criminally under-use it, failing at the time to understand or appreciate synthesis as a concept. Many years later, binge-watching videos of Wendy Carlos explaining synthesis awoke a curiosity within me, and I got hold of the JD-Xi again with the aim of experimenting and learning. While it is possible to edit basic synth parameters to create sounds from scratch, it's difficult; everything is hidden in various submenus, which are tedious to navigate and obfuscate the process, hindering creativity. To resolve this issue, I initially considered selling the JD-Xi and using the money to buy a Behringer Model D (or similar). However, while these synths do lend themselves to experimenting due to their one-knob-per-function, easy to use interfaces, they lack much of the additional functionality of the JD-Xi: effects, polyphony, velocity sensitivity, sequencing, presets, hundreds of PCM samples...
	<br><br>
Not wanting to give these things up, I decided that finding easier ways to manipulate the JD-Xi's parameters was probably the better course of action. Various editors have been made for the synth; these programmes display every controllable aspect of the synth in a GUI, and send changes the user makes there to the synth via a MIDI cable. While this works, it's not the most convenient for travel or jamming, requiring a laptop to be tethered to the synth. Further, it lacks the tactile experience of knobs, switches and buttons. More than a simple preference, this makes it very difficult to use without looking- a crucial part, in my opinion, of any instrument. So, I resolved to make a MIDI controller which would give me access to exactly what I needed for live jamming. I wanted it to take the form of a control panel which would hopefully be attached to the synth in some way, rendering it one instrument, without additional parts to lug around. I figured that with my coding and building experience in the past, this would be challenging but doable.</p>
