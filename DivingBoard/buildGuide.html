<h2>Hardware</h2>
<p>The hardware can be divided into the interior electronics, and the enclosure. The important bit would seem to be the former, but I'll cover what I did for the latter for the sake of completion.</p>
<h3>Interior Electronics</h3>
<p>The main brain of the DivingBoard is a Raspberry Pi. I used a Pi 3B+, but others should work just fine. I'd recommend keeping costs down by going for an older Pi- anything beyond a 3 is frankly overqualified for the task, and will waste money and power. A Pi Zero 2 might work quite well, but I've not had the opportunity to test with one yet.</p>

<p>The potentiometers used are 10K linear, and the encoders are the five-pin type, with three dedicated to the knob and two to a separate momentary switch. The LCD is a 4x20 HD44780 Character LCD. All can be found on Rapid Electronics, Mouser, Adafruit, etc.</p>

<p>The Pi can't handle analogue inputs for pots, nor low-latency inputs for the encoders, so an Arduino Nano (or similar) is used to read from them, and then report it's findings back to the Pi via serial over USB.</p>
