<h3>About:</h3>
<p>Song 1 of 12 in my lesser-known covers project.
<br><br>
This song is by a band called The Outs, who have quite a collection of neat tunes, evocative of Oasis, The Beatles, The Who, and others. This song, 'Get Around', is the first one of theirs I heard, after seeing a cover they did of Stop Crying Your Heart Out.</p>
<h4>Recording:</h4>
<p>For the style of the song, I decided to start in the same genre as the original, and then progressively weird-ify it with a collection of my favourite aspects of some other songs. Percussive influences come from Talking Heads (particularly David Byrne's performance of Slippery People in American Utopia on Broadway) and Oingo Boingo (the Forbidden Zone theme), the synth from The Who (Who Are You), and the weird vocals/chords later in the song are inspired by various Jacob Collier and Bill Wurtz songs. I won't pretend that I even got close to that level of complexity and musical ingenuity, but I was trying to channel that energy as I sang.</p>
<h4>Cover Art:</h4>
<p>Veeeeery lazy - it's just a still from the video with the appropriate text thrown over the top in preview, matching the thumbnail I'd created for YouTube.</p>
<h4>Video:</h4>
<p>The video was initially going to be simple, and the same sort of style as my video for <a href="https://youtu.be/uMWlN7WLEls" target="_blank">Fault Line</a>- that is, with video of the different instruments as they were being played, to show where all of the sounds came from. However, there were a <i>lot</i> of sounds in this cover, and I didn't really want to re-tread the same ground.<br><br>I've always thought it would be cool to meet a bunch of versions of myself from alternate dimensions, where I'd decided on an instrument other than the piano. That way, I'd be able to jam out with a group of people in exactly the way I simulate while recording music - a band of Olivers. I thought I'd try and re-create that idea in this video, so I filmed myself 'playing' each instrument (representing some via playing a unplugged synthesiser and MIDI keyboard, just for visual variety), and set about trying to put all of the Olivers into a single video. Alas, this was a complete failure- I edit with iMovie, and couldn't find any practical method for the masking required within the software. Instead, I jumped between the different videos, to show the different instruments as they were being played. The middle section with the light show was added to represent the style change in the audio, which I think worked rather nicely.</p>
<h4>In Retrospect:</h4>
<p>I'm quite proud of the vocals in this one. During puberty, I was gutted by the loss of my ability to consistently or nicely sing above an E4, resorting to some unpleasant-sounding techniques to try and sing higher. As my growth slowed down somewhat, I regained control of my voice, and began exploring it as a new instrument. By the time I recorded this cover, I was pretty confident with it, and was able to hit some good G4s throughout, as well as the mixed voice (I think- it's definitely not falsetto) G5 in the latter half of the song. That whole 'guitar solo' section was very fun to sing, and I think worked well.<br><br>Additionally, the percussion was a new exploration for me, as I usually rely on MIDI drums. I think it sounded pretty good, despite how hard it was to record (I have a really bad sense of rhythm, even with a metronome going). I spent a little while at the start of this project playing around with the different sounds available, which inspired most of the rest of my take on the song. I may have to invest some time in learning the drums at some point... this was lots of fun to do.</p>
